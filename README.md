# Bunch-O-wizzards
team collab to build a web page using api Pokemon

https://pielock.github.io/Bunch-O-wizzards/

This is your first group project and an opportunity to use the skills you've learned over the last five weeks.  
In this project, you will work in teams of three to wireframe, design, plan, and develop an interactive Web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that utilises one or more 3rd Party APIs.

Your application must:

- Accept and validate user input
- Query and use data from one or more 3rd Party APIs
- Display data-driven results to the user
- Be responsive across devices
- Be deployed on GitHub Pages
